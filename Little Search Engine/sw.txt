Most people in the world do not realize one’s dissociative phase in their lives when they are physically present at the current moment, but mentally they are absent. When dissociation occurs, people are not quite able to live their present lives with reality as they are distracted by past events or future thoughts. This distraction is caused because humans’ mind is more focused on other events or dreams, positive or negative, of their lives which makes them unable to live in the reality or to learn new things from their current life situation. For instance, when a student, in the class, is day-dreaming then that student is not mentally present in the class because a student’s brain is focused more on dream than in the class. At that very moment, a student’s mind is more focused on the dream. Traumatic events or negative events cause dissociation in humans and such dissociation is humans’ inner demon. An individual’s mind is mostly being controlled by an “inner demon”, a terrorist who is always controlling or “busy terrorizing [an individual]” (Thurman 441). The hidden demons in humans are always trying to hide a person’s real inner self. Inner self is a person's true or internal mind, soul, or nature. All humans have inner demons in different forms such as ego, negative thoughts, and dissociation. These demons make an individual unable to find the inner real self of oneself and also makes them unable to attain enlightenment in their life. To achieve enlightenment, an individual need to come back to one’s original nature by overcoming the demons inside them. The key to achieving enlightenment is an awareness that allows an individual to rise above or overcome the inner demons inside oneself.
